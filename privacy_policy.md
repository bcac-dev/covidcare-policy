While using  digital media from the mobile application or website, certain information will be gathered and stored about your usage of the digital media. This information does not identify you personally. We collect and store only the following information:

The number of times BCAC’s digital media was accessed
The pages or screens accessed or visited on BCAC’s digital media

The internet address or URL of the website visited immediately prior to visiting BCAC’s digital media
Collection and analysis of this information in the aggregate will help us enhance performance of our digital media, expand informational materials available through digital media, and improve overall customer experience.

### Use of Cookies

BCAC also uses web measurements and customization technologies (such as “cookies”). You can choose not to accept cookies by changing your browser settings. 

### Using BCAC’s Mobile Applications

When you use BCAC’s Mobile Applications (Apps), certain information will be gathered and stored about your usage of that App. This information does not identify you personally. We collect and store information as follows:
BCAC receives aggregate data about the use of our Apps, such as the number of times the applications have been opened or the interactions or actions completed in the application. We also receive aggregate data from the platforms that distribute our Apps to various app stores, such as the number of people who download the App and mobile set-up information (e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile carrier). We do not, however, receive information unique to you or your use of our Apps.

BCAC does not disclose, share, sell, or transfer any information about BCAC digital media visitors or users unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law.

For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, BCAC employs software programs to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

### Email Subscriptions

If you choose to provide your personal information to BCAC via its mobile application or the BCAC website  – for instance by sending us an e-mail message or completing a questionnaire, form, or other online survey found within the mobile applications or on the BCAC website –  BCAC will handle, use and maintain the information in accordance with all applicable federal laws. 

### Third-Party Websites

BCAC uses social media and third-party (non-BCAC) websites to share public health information and to engage the public. Your activity on those sites is governed by the third-party website’s security and privacy policies. Users of third-party sites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the site. Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party sites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be shared and used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party site to match your preferences.

Also, there may be third-party applications and/or services linked to or embedded on our website to improve its functionality. Likewise, applications created by BCAC may be embedded on third-party websites to increase public awareness of BCAC activities. Learn more about Third-Party Websites and Applications.

### Children and Privacy on BCAC.gov

We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) external icon governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. Our digital media is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from or about children under age 13, please contact the BCAC for Privacy at admin@blackcoalitionagainstcovid.org.
Updates to this Privacy Policy
We will revise or update this policy periodically.  If we make significant changes in the manner that we handle personal information, we will post those changes here and change the date at the bottom.  We will also provide additional advance notice on our website if material changes are made.
